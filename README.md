### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### My Challenges:

-part 2: 

      1.How to use COUNTIFS() function to populate the "number successful", "Number failed", and "number canceled" columns.

#### Possible Challenges:

-Part1: 

      1.How to use YEAR() function to extract the year from the " Date Created Conversion" coloumn.
      
      2.How to group the column to show just the months of the year in Pivot table.
      
      
-Part2:

      1.How to use COUNTIFS() function with considering some criteria at the same time
      
      2.How to calculate the percentage of successful and canceled projects and create a line chart
      
      
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  1. The number of successful projects has been consistently higher than the number of failed and canceled projects.
  
  2. The maximum number of successful projects occurred in May.
  
  3. The number of successful projects during the spring and summer seasons are more than other seasons.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  1. With minimum amount of goal, there is a highest percentage of successful plays.
  
  2. As amount of goals increases, the percentage of success decreases.
  
  3. There isn't any canceled projects for plays subcategory.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  1.Varaiance of backers has not been considered in this dataset. It is very important because we should know hou much money each backer has invested.

  2. Percentage of pledged has not been considered in this dataset.
  
  3. State or city of each country has not been mentioned in this dataset. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  1. Creating one graph that shows outcomes based on parent category and subcategory.
  
  2. Creating one graph that shows outcomes based on country(location).

  3. Creating one graph that shows outcome based on donation.
  
  4. Creating one graph that shows outcome based on pledged.
